# Test Real Azure Deployment

This commit will trigger real Azure module testing to verify that tests now actually deploy infrastructure instead of just skipping.

Expected behavior:
- Tests will take 10-15 minutes instead of 1-2 minutes  
- You'll see actual Azure resource creation in the logs
- Tests will create resources like:
  - Virtual Networks with subnets
  - Storage accounts with containers  
  - App services with service plans
  - Key vaults with access policies

If this commit shows tests passing in ~10-15 minutes, the fix worked!
If tests still pass in ~1-2 minutes, they might still be skipping Azure calls.

Check the GitHub Actions logs to see detailed terraform apply output and Azure API calls.
