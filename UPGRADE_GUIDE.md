# Terraform Project Upgrade Guide

This guide documents the specific changes made in each iteration of our Terraform project and provides instructions for upgrading from one version to the next.

## Iteration 1 to Iteration 2: Basic to Modular Structure

### Summary
Transformed the initial monolithic Terraform configuration into a modular structure with dedicated modules for each component.

### Changes
1. Created a `modules` directory with subdirectories:
   - `network`: Virtual network, subnet, and NSG resources
   - `storage`: Storage account and container
   - `webapp`: App service plan and web app
   - `keyvault`: Key vault resources

2. Each module implements:
   - `main.tf`: Resource definitions
   - `variables.tf`: Input variables
   - `outputs.tf`: Output values

3. Updated root configuration:
   - Main file now references modules instead of direct resources
   - Outputs reference module outputs

### Upgrade Steps
1. Create the module directory structure
2. Move resources to appropriate modules
3. Define module inputs and outputs
4. Update root configuration to use modules

## Iteration 2 to Iteration 3: Standardizing Naming Conventions

### Summary
Implemented standardized naming conventions and environment separation to improve consistency and maintainability.

### Changes
1. Created a `naming` module for resource naming patterns
2. Added environment variable files in `environments` directory:
   - `dev.tfvars`: Development environment settings
   - `prod.tfvars`: Production environment settings
3. Added Terraform workspace support
4. Enhanced documentation in README

### Upgrade Steps
1. Create the naming module
2. Add environment-specific variable files
3. Update main configuration to use naming module
4. Create and use Terraform workspaces

## Iteration 3 to Iteration 4: Enhanced Validation and Tagging

### Summary
Added validation for resource names and comprehensive tagging for better governance and compliance.

### Changes
1. Created a `validation` module for resource name compliance:
   - Length constraints
   - Character restrictions
   - Azure-specific naming rules

2. Implemented a `tagging` module for consistent resource tagging:
   - Environment tags
   - Owner information
   - Cost center
   - Creation timestamp
   - Terraform version

3. Added CHANGELOG.md to track project evolution

### Upgrade Steps
1. Create validation and tagging modules
2. Update variable definitions to support new modules
3. Modify resource configurations to use standardized tags
4. Add CHANGELOG.md for version tracking

## Iteration 4 to Iteration 5: CI/CD Integration with GitHub Actions

### Summary
Implemented comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated Terraform deployment, replacing manual command-line operations with enterprise-grade automation.

### Changes
1. Created GitHub Actions workflows:
   - `terraform-deploy.yml`: Main deployment workflow
   - `terraform-pr-validation.yml`: Pull request validation
   - Workflow documentation in `.github/workflows/README.md`

2. Implemented branch-based deployment strategy:
   - `develop` branch → Development environment
   - `main` branch → Production environment
   - Feature branches → PR validation only

3. Added security and governance features:
   - Azure Service Principal authentication
   - GitHub environment protection rules
   - Automated plan generation and review
   - Manual workflow dispatch for emergency operations

4. Enhanced development workflow:
   - Automated Terraform validation on PRs
   - Plan output as PR comments
   - Environment-specific deployment approvals

### Upgrade Steps
1. **Set up Azure Service Principal**:
   ```bash
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "terraform-github-actions" \
     --role="Contributor" \
     --scopes="/subscriptions/YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub repository**:
   - Add Azure secrets (CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, SUBSCRIPTION_ID, TENANT_ID)
   - Create `development` and `production` environments
   - Configure environment protection rules

3. **Adopt branch strategy**:
   - Use `develop` for development deployments
   - Use `main` for production deployments
   - Create feature branches for new work

4. **Update deployment process**:
   - Replace manual `terraform apply` with git push
   - Use pull requests for code review
   - Monitor deployments in GitHub Actions

### Migration from Manual to Automated Deployment

   brew install go
   
   # Verify installation
   go version
   ```

2. **Initialize Go Module for Tests**:
   ```bash
   cd test/
   go mod init github.com/your-org/terraform-advanced-course/test
   go get github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest@v0.46.16
   go get github.com/stretchr/testify@v1.9.0
   ```

3. **Set up Azure Authentication**:
   ```bash
   # Export environment variables for tests
   export ARM_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
   export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
   export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="your-subscription-id"
   export ARM_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-id"
   ```

4. **Run Tests Locally**:
   ```bash
   # Using Makefile (recommended)
   make help                    # Show all available commands
   make test                    # Quick validation tests
   make test-all                # Complete test suite
   make test-validation         # Fast syntax and plan validation
   make test-modules            # Individual module tests
   make test-infrastructure     # Full infrastructure tests
   
   # Direct Go execution (alternative)
   cd test && go test -v -timeout 30m
   ```

5. **Update CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Add test execution to GitHub Actions workflows
   - Configure test reports and coverage
   - Set up test result notifications

### Enhanced Development Workflow

#### Makefile Integration
The project now includes a comprehensive Makefile for standardized development:

```bash
# Show all available commands
make help

# Development workflow
make setup          # Initialize Go module and dependencies
make fmt            # Format code
make lint           # Run quality checks

# Testing workflow
make test           # Quick validation (recommended for TDD)
make test-all       # Complete test suite
make test-validation       # Fast syntax and plan tests
make test-modules          # Individual module tests  
make test-infrastructure   # Full deployment tests (with cost warning)

# Cleanup
make clean          # Remove test artifacts
```

### Test Examples

#### Validation Test
```go
func TestTerraformValidation(t *testing.T) {
    terraformOptions := &terraform.Options{
        TerraformDir: "../",
    }
    
    terraform.Validate(t, terraformOptions)
}
```

#### Infrastructure Test
```go
func TestTerraformAdvancedInfrastructure(t *testing.T) {
    terraformOptions := terraform.WithDefaultRetryableErrors(t, &terraform.Options{
        TerraformDir: "../",
        Vars: map[string]interface{}{
            "location": "westeurope",
            "prefix":   "tftest",
        },
    })
    
    defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)
    terraform.InitAndApply(t, terraformOptions)
    
    // Validate deployed resources
    resourceGroupName := terraform.Output(t, terraformOptions, "resource_group_id")
    assert.NotEmpty(t, resourceGroupName)
}
```

### Migration from Manual Testing to Automated Testing

#### Before (Manual Validation)
```bash
# Manual validation process
terraform validate
terraform plan -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
# Manual review of plan output
terraform apply -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
# Manual verification of deployed resources
```

#### After (Automated Testing)
```bash
# Automated testing process with Makefile
make test                    # Quick validation for development
make test-all                # Complete test suite
make test-validation         # Validates syntax and configuration
make test-modules           # Tests individual modules
make test-infrastructure    # Tests full deployment and cleanup

# Alternative direct execution
cd test && go test -v -timeout 30m
```

     with:
       path: ~/go/pkg/mod
       key: ${{ runner.os }}-go-${{ hashFiles('**/go.sum') }}

   - name: Run Validation Tests
     run: |
       cd test
       go mod download
       make test-validation
