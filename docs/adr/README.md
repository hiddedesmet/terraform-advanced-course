# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document significant architectural decisions made for this Terraform project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. Each ADR describes a single architectural decision.

## Why do we use ADRs?

- To document the rationale behind architectural decisions
- To provide context for current and future team members
- To track the evolution of the project's architecture
- To make the decision-making process transparent

New ADRs should follow this format:

```markdown
