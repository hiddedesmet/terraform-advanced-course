// Note: Infrastructure end-to-end tests that require Azure authentication have been removed
// These tests would require actual Azure deployment and authentication
// For CI/CD environments without Azure credentials, these tests are not suitable

// To run infrastructure tests in the future, you would need:
// 1. Azure Service Principal with appropriate permissions
// 2. Environment variables: ARM_CLIENT_ID, ARM_CLIENT_SECRET, ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, ARM_TENANT_ID
// 3. Actual Azure resource deployment (which incurs costs)
// 4. Sufficient Azure quota for all resources

// Example infrastructure tests that were removed:
// - TestTerraformAdvancedInfrastructure: Full end-to-end infrastructure deployment test

// These tests can be restored when Azure authentication is available
